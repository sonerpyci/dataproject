On the other hand H2k has very high skill ceiling imo, at their best they can defeat everyone but they can also choke and play poorly due to inconsistency specially mid to late game calls and that can be even worse against korean teams. Anyway i think h2k has the complete package with individual godlike players and hopefully are on good form as shown in 2nd week, they just need a bit of luck, pr0lly to have good drafts and NOT to choke which is a touch ask but still. You will probably say every year it's the same This western team will win the koreans, but at least i give you my reasoning, if players like Ryu,Forg1ven and jankos play their best they can do it imo.."

Hello there film fans. Some friends of mine and I have recently decided to write out our top ten favorite movies of all time and read them to each other in a PodCast discussion. I am trying to narrow my list down but am having difficulty completing it. Both in deciding which movies to include and in what order. I figured it might be good to hear from other movie buffs what your favorites are to process what movies I truly think are best. This is a list of our favorite movies. They are not the best movies of all time or the most critically well received but simply the movies that the hold the most re-watch value for me. There are some that cannot be included because they would be on all of our lists. Those films are: any Star Wars film, LOTR Trilogy and The Matrix. My friends and I grew up watching those so they just take up space on the list. Love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!"

If the NHL continues to hold World Cups, I hope they keep Team North America or at least some sort of lineup made with the league's young talent.

CalebDK	army	7	7	0	2016-09	1473333694	My unit needs to get its shit together, get it all together, and put it in a ruck sack, all its shit, so it's together. When I came to my unit in June, I told that that I had use it or lose it days and needed to take some leave before October 1st. My last unit would only approve block leave, so I could never really get below 60 days leave for long. No worries, my platoon sergeant says Go ahead and take *these specific days.* So I put in a leave packet, got it approved. Then two days before my leave starts, my squad leader calls me and says, Hey, bro, the battalion next door is putting on a whole week of machine gun classes and ranges. You're in charge of taking all the gunners and AGs to that. Guess your leave is canceled. That's no problem, I know that shit happens. I just ask when I can reschedule and the PSG says Oh, man, my bad, put in a leave packet for *these specific dates.* So I do that, and I get it approved, and I do the fucking MG course, and shoot expert because machine guns are easy. Then, the day before I sign out on leave, my squad leader says Hey bro, your leave is fucked. You gotta go to this other fucking school for 2 weeks. You leave this Sunday (the day before the 4th of July)! I hope you didn't have any plans with your family. Lol But whatever, I've been in the Army a while, I'm used to getting the ol' green shaft. This time, my PL doesn't wait for me to ask. He comes to me and says Hey, really sorry that your leave got canceled again. Put in a new packet for September. I'll personally make sure it gets through. So that's what I do. I get 15 days of leave approved, and I actually signed out yesterday morning. Fuck yeah! Until today, when my squad leader called and said Hey bro! We just signed you up for a class to get trained on equipment that we don't have in the company - and we will never have - so make sure you're back Monday morning for that bullshit! Lol! Again - I can't stress this part enough - they told me which days to take all 3 times. The specific days that worked for them. There's not enough whisky in the world for these shenanigans. /rant"

This may have been posted before. If so, I've never seen it. No one is going to argue that Drew Brees is a bad quarterback. When mentioning the all-time greats though, his name is never mentioned. *Take a look at his career rankings in some statistical categories:* Yards - 3rd (64,490) Pass Completion Percentage - 1st (66.6%) Passing Yards per Game - 1st (282.9) Yards per Game - 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 13th Completion Percentage - 1st, 3rd, 4th, 13th Completions - 3rd (5,691) Touchdowns - 3rd (458) Passer Rating - 6th (96.6) 4th Quarter Comebacks - 10th (28) *Let's look at his single season record rankings:* Pass Completions - 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 11th, 13th Passing Yards - 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 10th, 14th Touchdowns - 5th, 8th, 12th Passer Rating - 15th A lot of Brees's numbers are written off due to him being a part of a pass happy team. Why is it that this is an excuse to disregard Brees but Manning is argued to be the best? A lot of people will point at his record over the last few season and say he doesn't have the record of an all-time great. Leading up to Bountygate (which really hurt the team long-term) he went 13-3, 11-5, and 13-3 with a Super Bowl win and Super Bowl MVP to boot. He's won Offensive Player of the Year twice. He's a 9 time Pro Bowler and 2 time All-Pro. **So can someone tell me why he isn't in the conversation with Manning, Brady, Montana, Elway, Marino, Favre, and Unitas as the greatest of all-time?**"

"0	Bodom + Grinder is all you need bby.	BefokkedBefucked	Coffee	-3	-1	-1	2016-11	1478265697	Spend more upfront for an espresso machine? As a daily latte drinker who spends $5+ dollars on coffee a day, I'm thinking about investing in an espresso machine and grinder to save money over time. Yes, it won't save me money immediately, but perhaps over 5-years. So as a newbie to espresso machines, my question is: does it make sense to buy an expensive prosumer espresso machine and grinder outright? Or is it better to start conservatively and then upgrade/ramp-up over time? I understand this is probably just personal preference. When I started researching machines, I thought the oft recommended second-hand Gaggia Classic (pre-Phillips) @ ~$250-300 would be a good starter machine. However, some people said it's really the *bare* minimum for decent espresso and I feel I may want to upgrade down the line from this minimum. I'm thinking about getting a prosumer machine like the Rocket Appartamento or similar. I could budget ~$1.5k to $2k for a machine + grinder. My thinking is that I'd rather buy something once and if I pay more upfront, I can get a quality machine that will last a while/not have the urge to upgrade. I'm looking for a machine that's easy to maintain with good/affordable parts availability and that's well-built and will last 5+ years with infrequent maintenance."

Obviously, most people aren't trading LeVeon, Antonio, DJ, Zeke, Julio, etc. Outside the consensus top 2 or 3 at each position, who do you personally view as untouchable? For me, it is Marvin Jones. First of all, I drafted him as my WR3 in the 7th round, so the value there is tremendous. Secondly, after losing Keenan Allen, his value increased even more. Finally, I feel like he is in the perfect situation to finish in the top 10 at WR this year regardless of his draft position. Who on your team is virtually untouchable?"

"0	Forza Horizons 3's demo (not beta) didn't seem to impact its sales.	Cool_Hwip_Luke	xboxone	4	-1	-1	2016-11	1478272436	Honestly I feel like the term beta has lost all meaning to gamers. People just will not view it as anything other than a free look at finished parts of the game.. which is sad. People were convinced, *completely* convinced that the beta was it. Anyone who said guys, give feedback but remember this is a beta, not the final product was screamed down with THATS NOT HOW BETAS WORK NOW THIS IS THE FINISHED PRODUCT THEY WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING SHUT UP I HATE YOU!. Well.. they did. That's the point of a real beta and if people take the attitude you're taking now, that you consider the beta to be representative of the real game even though many people have said that it's not? We won't get any real betas, where we actually have a chance to voice concerns and have things changed before launch. We'll just get the laggy server stress tests a week before launch and that's it. Now I don't disagree that a trial would be nice.. but the reason almost no games have demos these days is simple: it was shown to reduce sales. Playable demos = less sales overall. Big flashy trailers and no demo? Lots of sales. Sad but true. So until initial sales die down and they want to boost the playerbase in a few months with a free weekend? You'll just have to decide if it's something you want or not."

Seattle is rich, and full of early adopters. I see more Teslas here in a day than my buddy in NOLA sees in a month. 2. The light rail seems to be somewhat outgunned both in carriage size and number of stops. 3. Deploying smart vehicles that brake and merge correctly seems faster and sexier/more luxurious than a public transport solution. 4. Seattle is politically progressive, and would be more likely to legalize self driving vehicles sooner than other municipalities. I'd love to hear counter arguments however, as it would be sweet if the light rail is actually the savior we need."

The main problem with Pelosi and her ilk is that they have been disingenuous. They talked a good game but when they were in power they bailed out the banks without jailing any bankers. They essentially gave huge handouts to big pharma and the health insurance industry in the ACA. They supported the executive branch's ability to spy on US citizens.

BC's homeowner grant program already requires people to disclose their primary residence and our government's possess a lot of other information in tax records. People could attempt to subvert the law, but committing tax fraud is a pretty risky move for a real-estate investment. I don't think people have fully appreciated the effect this policy might have."

"0	Do you have something else to recommend that contains similar content?	Vichnaiev	unrealengine	1	-1	-1	2016-12	1481283092	As wonderfully written as this book is I do not recommend using it to learn coding for unreal engine. It uses 4.5.1 and if you use a version of unreal that is newer you will have spend time researching why your code isn't compiling. I'm using it for an unreal class right now and the changes in the unreal code has caused me to lose a lot of time researching and finding updates. If you do decide to read this book, the plus side is chapters 1 through 7 will be useful and is very easy to read and not too wordy like many programming books. These chapters are to teach you the basics of c++. Chapters 8 through 12 begin introducing you to unreal engine. They use version 4.5.1 which will require visual studio 2013 to run (should you choose to do 4.5.1). I believe from 4.6.x and onward uses visual studio 2015. Oh and if you use a newer version of unreal from 4.5.1 your asset names will be different. For example, your character mesh skin will not have the same names. I would highly recommend that you follow closely to the source code that this book gives. They tend to leave out little details like your #include headers and it will give you errors. Small things such as this is easy to overlook when they spoon feed you the code to write. One last thing, in chapter 8 you will be putting some UPROPERTY's in your code. If they contain a property that is BlueprintReadWrite and any other BlueprintX property you have to put them under public declaration. By default they are private and will cause compilation errors if you put them under the GENERATED_BODY() like the book shows."

[push-agenda-here], [troll-a-bit-there]. It's disingenuous. Many in this sub are spinning this whole saga like the media would spin something. Take a look at the press conference where Amla was standing with the whole team behind him - the interviewer said something like Do you take joy from the Australian team's pain?. That was so provocative as to be embarrassing, it had nothing to do with the matter at hand. On that note, what has this security/journo thing got to do with the tampering charge? It's too easy to paint every single thing that the South Africans do now as villainous. Did anyone see footage before or after this incident? No. I'm not outright defending SA, or Faf. I found it weird that he denied the charge. But then again we haven't heard his side yet - maybe he was denying the _intention_ to alter the ball. I don't think he's stupid enough to deny that he put his finger in his mouth after he fucking saw footage of himself putting his finger in his mouth."

Never mind you get points for each point of damage you do via gas grenade which means you can throw it on a choke point and focus on another choke point as it will act like a proximity scan, giving you a hint when an enemy is hit by the gas.

She's 16 years older than me, and I'm young, so, hopefully, she will be around for a long time. I don't have a creepy codependent relationship with her, and we don't even spend that much time together, but I cherish her more than anyone in my life."

I don't let them stop me unless it's at a place like Sam's Club or Costco (Because they require a membership and I sign something that says I have to let them stop me) because the moment that I have paid for an item it becomes mine, and they have no right or reason to rifle through my property without a warrant and an officer."

The front tire was almost flat, but I didn't think that'd be a big deal. I got to the end of the driveway, went to turn and the front wheel jack-knifed. The handlebars dug into my crotch as I flew over the top of the bicycle onto the pavement. It ripped a huge hole in my shorts and blood was gushing everywhere. I knew something was really wrong but wasn't sure how bad the damage was. I hobbled back into the house to the bathroom where I could take a look at my bleeding package. On inspection, I had one testicle hanging completely out and a cut above my penis. Drove myself to the E.R. where they ended up taking me into surgery- I had split my scrotum open completely front to back! The most painful part was the ultrasound the gorgeous brunette did on my exposed testicles before the surgery to check that none of the plumbing was damaged. My neighbor now calls me Ziploc."

J_Paul	Fitness	10	-1	-1	2016-12	1482213221	I used to be a professional IG body builder and powerlifter (I would have gone pro if they let quarter squats count. Full squats are bad for your back anyways). SL5x5 is total shit and no one should listen to that old man. OP, if you want to build serious muscle and get all the gains you need to stick to the 4 major lifts: - Curling in the squat stand with the straight bar. - Curling on the oly platform with the oly bar (that extra whip really helps). - Curling with a curl bar while standing over the barbell bench - Curling dumbbells in the power rack."

But by her third song of the night has drank far too many vodka sodas, causing her motor skills and already less-than-perfect singing voice to take a hit. But she doesn't notice. In her eyes she is a rockstar, she *owns* this room! Those people aren't laughing at her! No, they are enjoying her God given gift to lift spirits simply with her voice. By the end of the evening, when she has tired of beating her pleading friends away (who probably only want her to get off stage to give other people a chance), and her vocal chords are raw, she finds a seat at the bar, and waits for the male suitors to come running. But they never do. Likely too intimidated by her soulful voice; fearful they would never bring enough to the table to impress such a beautiful siren. So she is forced to settle for Big Dan, the resident biker of the bar, who is no more than a morbidly obese accountant by day, who happened to get a great rate on a used Goldwing."

SPcrusader	starcraft	1	1	0	2016-09	1474237469	I think a lot of the gripes about protoss can be explained by the fact that people forget that Protoss units are designed to be twice as strong and twice as expensive as other races' units, especially compared to zerg, which are designed to be cheap and weak. So when you're zerg, and you have an army twice the size of Protoss, you may actually still be quite outmatched, despite it looking more even than it is. That said, I've been wondering about this too. Zerg doesn't seem to have great anti-air options. Terran has goliaths, thors, and Vikings. Protoss has Phoenix and carriers. I feel like zerg doesn't have anything that really shreds through air units though. Mutas seem better in smaller numbers as fly-by shooters. Hydra are good, but they're very squishy. I don't play multiplayer though, so I probably wouldn't know."

Then, they would sync with iTunes later, iTunes would notice all the songs are gone, and it would delete all the mp3s that they had just loaded on. Only Apple could make software so confusing and game-changing that it would delete entire folders without asking. Of course, NOW it's a little more clear."

We went away for a vacation for about a week. Got our friend to pet sit for us, told Lady Susan when we go away and get back but didnt say anything about pet sitting situation. (We were young and naive. We learned) Friend decided to crash on our couch as he has a nightmare of a mother too and was living with her at that point. He buys some junk food and, not expecting an ambush, leaves some of it on a kitchen table. Next thing he knows, it's saturday morning, he wakes up to Lady Susan casually letting herself in. He panics, mumbles something to her and locks himself in the bedroom. Lady Susan, never one to be deterred, helps herself to our coffe, enjoys a sigarette and fucking eats poor guy's food, then leaves. When we came back and confronted her about it, she made innocent eyes and said she thought we left those treats for her. She never explained why she was letting herself in without invitation in the first place."

"0	I feel like the turning animations or turn rate with WASD keys makes the game feel slower too, smooth and slow instead of quick and twitchy.	Makezuki	BattleRite	1	1	0	2016-09	1473117002	my beta weekend impressions and feedback First ill start with the negatives: * As many have stated, the movement speed is a bit low. Upping it by 5% should really help the game feel more fluid. However the main clunkiness (is this a word?) comes from the running animations. I think the running animations are terrible. It's like everyone is walking or running in a pile of mud. I believe that if those animations are changed, then that will help the game look a lot more fluid. * Getting slowed while M1'ing feels very very bad. It might be okay for ranged champions but for melee, it sucks. It's the reason I'm not playing Freya. She doesn't just slow down, but has this terrible marching / walking animation while M1'ing. I feel like I'm gimping myself while holding my left click. I really have that feeling like I will never reach anyone. The reason Croak feels really good is because he's really mobile with the double jump and also his camo stuns with the first hit meaning you won't feel the movement speed slow while holding M1. * Understanding if your skill is on cooldown is a bit hard. I know that a little popup comes next to your character telling you how many seconds are left but I think the popup is too small. Continuing with the positives: * Battlerites are an awesome addition to the game. I constantly feel like I am adapting to the enemy team by picking different battlerites every game. Love it! * The game is really exciting to play and I really couldn't stop playing during the weekend. TL;DR Overall I really like the game but feel like the walking/running animations are terrible and they really stand out where everything else in the game is lovely."

"0	So level 4 is a player who thinks his opponent thinks he knows what he thinks he has?	twoshoesonesock	poker	2	2	0	2016-09	1475185072	Your friends are level 0 players. They play what they feel are good cards and bet randomly in weird spots basically because they don't know what to do. The way to beat a player like that is to play level 1 play. A level 1 player plays tight and aggressive but the key word is tight. Only good cards, minimum bluffs. The way to beat a level 1 player is by level 2 play. A level 2 player makes his plays based off what he thinks you have. Uses his read for 90% of all situations. To beat them is level 3 play. A level 3 player plays based off what he thinks his opponent thinks he has. It goes on and on and on. You must only go up 1 rank when trying to beat someone. Level 2 play doesn't work against a level 0 because you have no idea how to narrow their range. Level 3 play doesn't work against level 1 because the level 1 player isn't reading he's playing his cards. It's easy to practice and once you pin a number on someone it makes keeping track of play styles easier which in turn makes your reads more efficient."

After joining the crackhouse in January I've spent my time growing my fountain collection, not too impressive compared to some other people's (obviously) but I'm happy with where it is at the moment. I've spent the past year with only two ink colors, and I've decided that I want to spend my time (or better yet, use my wallet) to increase the variation of inks that I have. Thus far I have 3 colors: Noodler's Black, Noodler's Berning Red, and Noodler's Liberty's Elysium (if you couldn't tell I really like Noodler's). I'm looking for are suggestions as to any inks that are must haves. While I understand that generally ink is a what works for you thing, I'm looking for inks that everyone generally seems to have, or inks that are held in high-esteem within the FP community. An example of one of the inks I'm talking about would be Noodler's Apache Sunset, as it seems that everyone, or at least a lot of people, have that ink. Pretty much inks that flaunt unique colors or properties that won't clog or stain a pen. So far I've decided on getting Dragon's Napalm and a large bottle of Baystate Blue once that comes back in stock at Goulet Pens (want the free Charlie pen so I don't ruin one of my TWSBIs). tl;dr: In your opinion what are the best inks/must haves?"

The Nutshack theme came to be known mostly through HQRips. The Nutshack is an essential part of the channel's identity. It's also no secret that MyxTV and NUMP have been asked to release a full version of The Nutshack theme. There's high demand for it, much higher than when The Nutshack was airing. SPECULATION FOLLOWS ---------------------------------------- Surprised by these turn of events, Myx TV and NUMP set out to find out why The Nutshack got so popular all of a sudden. They inevitably find out about SiIvaGunner. MyxTV, NUMP, and the Team begin talks about The Nutshack theme before the channel ends. MyxTV and NUMP are told about plans for Volume 7, and the other planned rips. MyxTV and NUMP decide to capitalize on this, and get to work on making a full Nutshack theme, because in reality a full version did not exist. **tl;dr**: nump's a collaborator for volume 7 and he's gonna contribute the full nutshack theme additional: there's also gonna be a High Quality Version where the lyrics are SiIva-based"

The raccoon then passed out and the drunk tossed it on the passenger floor. When the raccoon woke up it went into a rage and attacked the drunk, who was now driving, causing him to crash. The report, though super funny, was proven to be a fake."

You have some orthodox Jews who tend to lean more right, and then the Jews who half-heartedly practice, but don't really believe in their faith, who tend to make up the Soros's, the Hollywood elite, etc. It's no different with Catholics (which ironically are as close to Judaism as Christianity gets, and I can say that, as a Catholic). You have your people who are true-blue in the faith, and then you have your people who just show up on Sundays and holidays as a matter of tradition but don't really pay much attention, other than to cherry pick what makes them feel better about themselves and forget everything the second they walk out the doors. Every faith has their frauds."

Total had just lost a big exploration contract in Libya to the Germans, and Gadaffi perhaps became expendable in operation re-elect Sarkozy. I wouldn't give David Cameron a pass out on this though, he was still settling up scores from the 1980's. Whilst Hillary Clinton was in league with Qatar, a country who mysteriously stepped up to the plate to flag Libyan oil on behalf of the rebels. It was a quite deadly confluence really"

Just out of curiosity from current BMW owners, how much do you think the 2015/2016 CPO BMW M3s will drop in price with the arrival of the '17 models in the fall? I know they maintain their value quite well. From going over the market recently, I've seen them going from $60k up to $70k.

Mists and moonlight on the other hand impact everyone, so if survivors make the moonlight darker and the mist thick, they're potentially hindering themselves as well because it makes it more difficult to spot the killer in the distance. Same goes for when the killer makes the moonlight brighter - the killer can potentially spot the survivors easier, but they make it possible for the survivors to spot the killer easier as well. The map offerings I don't have an issue with the offerings themselves, just with the poor balance within some of the maps."

GronkeyDonkey	politics	5	-1	-1	2016-11	1479758894	I get the feeling that winning the electoral college but not the popular vote was the polar opposite of what Trump wanted.

Among those companies that do, you might find yourself taken advantage of. And, again, if you're in the US, it's just not the professional norm to try to obtain an office job by walk-in. I think if you went in, handed someone a business card, and explained yourself a bit, that would be OK. But don't put anybody on the spot. If you're looking to do something for free to boost your resume, hop onto VolunteerMatch or some similar site and search for charities looking for help with their sites or other software. Or if you don't mind being paid garbage at first, try freelancing, or going to one of the shitty recruiting agencies like Robert Half Technology (but stay away from EDP Recruiting). Sounds like you just need to get your foot in the door, and that's often tough. I assume you have an okay portfolio? Make sure you talk it up when you finally start getting your little breaks."

How in the world can you consider the playlist competitive AT ALL when you have SND rounds at first to 4. To me this is such a joke and I cannot take the developers of this game seriously at all. In order to be competitive we need to be playing the same maps and rules that the professionals are playing in the CWL. This is something that Black Ops 3 had and a lot of people who did not play GBs enjoyed the rank system in Arena. Even ADVANCED WARFARE which allowed Variants (Just like IW) at least had SND rounds in the Ranked Playlist to First to 6. 4 round SND is a complete JOKE and waste of time. I truly hope that IW learns to update the competitive playlist to the same rules and maps that the CWL follows. Despite not being a fan of the game if they had this I actually think I might play the game some to have a similar experience to my favorite pro's. Right now the only way to play true SND first to 6 is through GB, and in all honesty who really besides the pros is playing GB on IW over MWR?"

Yayyyyyyyyy I'm sure you've all seen it. People complaining about either never being able to surpass a certain skill tier, or I'm better but my teammates are holding me back. For the latter, there is some truth to this. In team games where you have to depend on your teammates, its very hard to win consistently. You may think there is an elo where your teammates get good, they group up, they stop going troll picks. Frankly, thats never going to happen. People, ( including me, though to a lesser extent) will always do whatever the fuck they think is correct, which is usually not. Which brings me to my next point. It's pretty difficult to improve in this game.It's very hard just to play the game and naturally get better. You're constantly being matched with people that are the same skill level, and do the same mistakes as you. Before I started my hiatus, I played solely glaive, including Glaive roam. I never got better because I actually won with this. I never understood that you needed to buy scout traps, you needed to build utility items. I always thought it was my team's fault I was stuck is tier 6. Another thing is that people tend to always blame others a lot. We would've won but my team was bad The people that say this improve very slowly/ never improve at all. It's very difficult to notice your own mistakes in contrast to your teammates, but if you do fix them you improve very fast. My personal problem is that I get bloodlusted very easily. I tend to rush in and try to kill everyone without my roamer initiating/checking if I'm jumping into a trap. Dead ozo, 200 question marks. Another reason its hard to improve is that there just aren't enough resources. There's definitely some, but not enough for assisting. (On a side note, For those that criticize VaingloryFire, why don't you WRITE A FUCKING GUIDE AND IMPROVE IT INSTEAD OF JUST DISMISSING IT AS A SHITTY SITE. It is, and probably will continue to be the most popular site beginners will go on. ) For those that really want to get more elo, I'd say play roam. It's the role that gets played wrong the most often in lower skill tiers. Carries carry, but a bad carry and an ok carry is very similar, while a bad roam and an ok roam has MANY differences."

"1	Patiently waiting for your first appreciation thread post.	D4R1N	OpTicGaming	9	-1	-1	2016-12	1482552673	Die-Hard TSM Fan LF New Home Hey there Optic! So, as I'm sure most of you have seen, in the last 48 hours Reginald has done more to damage the TSM brand than Sean Gares could ever do (especially considering he did 0 damage to the team in the first place). Rough stuff. After watching Richard Lewis' newest video, I've about had it with TSM. Just recently, I posted on the TSM subreddit outlining a few of Regi's mistakes in the past and mentioned a link to RL's new video and found myself shadowbanned from the subreddit. That's just how things are run over there. I've been an extremely loyal fan since 2012. I tried to get in to all of the games that Andy sponsored and did for the most part. I remember when I first started following TSM, Reginald was a player. It always bothered me how abrasive he was in the TSM videos and it caused me to really dislike the guy. Throughout the years, I bought into the TSM propaganda that everything was good and Andy had matured. He treated all of his players like angels...blah blah blah. Well, obviously, that isn't true. I'm not going to cheer for an organization that treats their players this way. TSM needs someone to step in or Reginald is going to bring his whole house down. Sorry, rant is over. I want a new home. I've been doing a lot of reading about Optic and how it is set up fundamentally and I must say it's really impressive. It really does seem to be an organization that is solely structured around success in both video games and life without any compromise in moral dignity. I really appreciate that especially after reading what I've read. I wanted to hear from you guys, how is Optic? Do you often find your experiences with fellow fans pleasant? Everything I have heard has been positive so I hear by announce my allegiance to Optic Gaming. Feelsgoodman. [TL;DR] Tired of backing an org. with a child for a leader. Time for something new.

Jax currently loses the laning phase, power spikes like a motherfucker at 1-3 items, then falls off a goddamn cliff once resists start getting built, LDR comes out, and he starts to do 25% damage to tanks while ADCs pen 45% of his armor. Rather than go with the GIVE HIM %HP DAMAGE GIVE HIM TRUE DAMAGE JACK UP HIS BASE STATS approach that other people do, I suggest a second part of his passive (so he has 3 passives, you know, like modern kits) that gives him 5/12.5/20% bonus armor/MR penetration at 1/11/16. To keep this in perspective: This would give Jax against your average ADC with 9 armor runes/GA ~13 armor pen. Not that big of a deal. HOWEVER, it would allow him to actually put a dent in tanks and more effectively splitpush or team fight. It would fix a shitload of his issues in competitive games. Primarily: A. Fighting against tanks. B. Killing tanks that are sitting under turret stonewalling his split push with a thornmail. C. Fighting 1v1 against Riot's new babies (Fiora, Camille, Yasuo, etc.)"

BornInTheCCCP	newzealand	1	1	0	2016-09	1473181480	Having one or two investment properties is fine. Not everyone will be in the posistion to buy a house, so we need those houses for renters to live in., Owning 30? That's a bit of a joke. BF has MORE then enough money to buy his own house after the EQs, had his own deposit money AND money from kiwisaver, so he had a fair chunk for only just a 23 year old, but he kept getting outbid by investors, which was so shitty. We even got to the point where we look at houses that needed work, and were cheaper, because we were keen to do the work ourselves over time. Kao. Investors outbid on those houses too. How the fuck are you suppsoed to get off your feet and into the market when you have MORE then enough money to buy a home, but investors have even more money. 30 houses is a fucking joke, and frankly I'm a little jelly. I can't even buy one house. :("

He got his own card in TCG, his own stage in Shuffle and Picross. Plus, it doesn't make too much sense for the anime to showcase a new form/Pokemon that won't be in the games. Secondly, I know people are upset that Ash-Greninja won't resemble your character. Think about all the different models that GF would have to make for a single Pokemon. Some would argue It could just have your color scheme. The problem I find with that is that someone might not like the coloring on their Ash-Greninja. So they stick with one model so that people can enjoy the way it is. Also, in the anime, (I know I'm getting a bit too technical) they show that there was a Legendary Ninja Hero Greninja that has the same appearance as Ash-Greninja. Lastly, you don't have to use it if you really don't want to. That's pretty much what Pokemon team building is, use the ones you like and don't use the ones you don't like."

It's illegal to cycle on the pavement unless there's a marked cycle lane. We're not pedestrians unless we're completely dismounted.

I've been there, women are open, well-educated, self-confident and have no problem with speaking to foreign men in public. Iran is a safe country to travel to at the worst of times, and when you are part of an organized travel group, like when you are attending a tournament, you will be absolutely fine. Yes you'll have to wear the headscarf, but that can be a light, almost transparent piece of cloth that doesn't even have to cover all of your hair. Not going because of that is ludicrous. If you are actually concerned about women's rights in Iran, go and have conversations with locals and ask them what to do. Boycotting an event that could draw attention to their situation is the last thing that would help them. Iran is a beautiful country and is strongly connected with the history of chess.

"1	Using American law to form an opinion on a Chinese contract, SeemsLegit	DotaAndKush	DotA2	0	-1	-1	2016-10	1475877991	As is the case in most contract disputes, it sounds like both sides could have handled this better. I am a little hazy on some of the timing but...I do want to point out saying okay to a proposed distribution is hardly acceptance. It's acknowledgment. Also, if Ana was still under 18 at the time he responded, even if it is deemed acceptance, it is invalid as he was still a minor. As for his leaving and screwing over iG, at least under American law a party has the right to terminate a contract if the other party commits a material breach. Based on the totality of the contract, a failure to pay $12,000 (assuming this could be deemed part of the contract) would probably be material enough for Ana to cancel the contract. As to iG's comments that Ana should not request money on a contract he terminated, a party is owed either the contract value or fair market value of services performed under a valid contract that was later cancelled due to breach. Even the breaching party must get paid for work completed, minus damages. So at least under American law this doesn't make sense, Ana would still be owed money even if he was the breaching party. I think players need better resources when getting their first shot, especially when the industry regularly recruits sub 18 year olds, as they are absolutely clueless as to the legal significance of the deals they make. I personally think it would be cool if some of the bigger named groups and players would agree to take a small percentage of their winnings to give to a non-profit group created to provide legal assistance to new, young players for a small fee. The new players could call a hotline or email the group and the donated money would pay for an attorney to review and redline the contract, or provide advice on their first deal. Just a thought."

But without CC it's hard to guarantee getting that damage off in ganks, so she must be able to power up through something else other than kill gold - which is farming. Graves is in the same spot honestly. If you nuke their farming ability they will end up being super worthless in every game they don't get early kills. Other early game junglers who rely on snowballing like Lee Sin and Elise at least do have CC which can always turn those team fights mid-late game."

I'm glad they have the no kill policy too. I don't necessarily have a problem with the killings so far in the DCMU. I think it presents an opportunity for some character growth. Superman's decision to kill Zod in order to save that family was devastating for him, but I would argue it was the moral choice, as his inaction would have resulted in more than one death. Ultimately, the script could have been written differently so that particular dilemma never happened, but personally, I thought it was a strong point of the movie. When Superman returns from the grave, I have a feeling he will embody the optimism and goodness we all want--and will do everything in his power to prevent killing. Batman, as we know, has been in the game for so long that he's grown callous and now kills. I think it's likely that this will change, too, as he regains some of what he's lost by working with the League. I'd argue character progression (in this instance, changing oneself and one's morals) is pivotal for a good movie. If Superman and Batman remained the same throughout the entire DCMU, it would be boring. And I 100%, at the end of the day, prefer our heroes to IMPROVE their heroism as the movies progress rather than decay. In other words, I'd rather see them killing now and working to change, rather than starting good and becoming darker."

It's pretty weird how they're in the map but serve no purpose. You could argue that they're similar to the Annihilator Pistol where they actually don't do anything but that's just one map where the specialist does nothing. Here is what I propose, in Der Eisendrache the 4 panels you stand on to go to the boss fight are the main reason the Rags are present on the map. Wouldn't it stand to reason you would need to place them down in 4 separate locations? Placing them back onto the panels in DE is too obvious, Treyarch wouldn't place the same Easter egg twice in the same location. My suggestion place RDG2 in 4 seperate locations that are iconic or at least somewhat memorable: 1: Center of Shangri-La 2: Electric Chair in MoTD 3: PAP location in Origins 4: Projector room in Kino The last one is a bit of a stretch as I'm unsure where you'd place the last Rag.

Some defending him may not know that while injured ( which seemed to be longer than most thought he should be ) he was off traveling to tennis matches all over the world with his girlfriend. Even while fit he was taking midweek flights back to Germany. The point is that he didn't really do what was needed to properly integrate with the team - he behaved like a mercenary.

I can obviously see there are more and more black people being shot by cops with the scenes captured on video but that doesn't mean their exclusive to police abuse. There was a white man at UCSB iirc that got shot several times in his own car unarmed because he was arguing about a traffic ticket. I hate people that bring up race on either side when this happens. The situation is one man was shot by another in an unjust manner.

That said, why does Wendy Mericle seem to escape so much of the spotlight? Guggie was working on 3 different shows this season and spread way the fuck out. I have no doubt that he's had a massive hand in wrecking Arrow, but it hasn't been all him at all and I'm sure Wendy Mericle has had a very significant hand in the way they story has gone in this past season. The drama and bullshit suits her to a T, and as far as I can tell she didn't have anything like the other commitments that Guggenheim had during season 4, she was pretty focused on Arrow."

"1	Religion is harmless.	Jim-Jones	atheism	2	2	0	2016-07	1468279036	Just had to get this off of my chest while dealing with a christian family during a time of crisis... So, I had to get this off my chest, mainly to iron out my thoughts during a difficult time with my family. My family, including all three of my siblings are deeply religious (Reformed Presbyterian). I was excommunicated about 5 years ago ( a different story altogether) and am an atheist. I love my family very much and for the most part have come to grips with our differences and are able to have a healthy relationship, but there are times when it is trying. We found out last weekend that my mom had a cancerous tumor on her tongue, as well as some dark spots on her lymph nodes which also could be cancer. She has been battling depression for many years as well, even to the point of going through several rounds of electro-shock therapy. She feels enormous guilt, like god is punishing her for something and the church she attends piles it on as well. She never feels good enough for god and it is a vicious cycle. She prayed and prayed to be healed or at least to have her mood improved, but it never happened. She just got worse. Three weeks ago she told me she prayed to god to find a way to end her life without her having to commit suicide. She said she knows it wasn't right, but she can barely take each day. I did my best to encourage her with how much the family loves her and how I want my 2 year old daughter to grow up knowing her as well and that seems to help a little bit, but it just isn't enough. What really bothers me though is that now she has cancer, recently diagnosed and the rest of my family thinks this is her answer to the prayer that she wanted to end her life without committing suicide. How messed up is that that they think god answers that prayer to make her worse, but not the million times she prayed to get better? They explain it that god has a plan, but really it is their own way of coping with what is going on with her, so that now this prayer is answered it all makes sense and that it was god all along. It just disturbs me that this is the way things are in my family and that church community. I cannot get through to them with how freeing and uplifting it is to live without the heavy weight of legalistic guilt following me around all the time. It makes me appreciate life all the more, it doesn't detract from it. I think they would be a lot less resigned to the way things are with my mom if they didn't try to justify it as god's plan. My mom is going to try to fight it with surgery and chemo therapy, but I am worried that with as fragile and weak willed as she is with her depression she is not going to win.

Sure he's not a 30 goal a season striker but he has always tried his best for us and did as much as he could to score goals and win us games. Maybe these are just rumours and nothing is obviously confirmed.. But seeing Giroud leave our club for a swap deal is bad business IMO and would genuinely make me sad.

One of these days, you'll need a job, and it won't be the job you want. It will be the job you can get, and you'll work that job because you need to eat, drink, bathe, and have a building to sleep in. The first one you get will probably be incredibly undignified, requiring you to put up with terrible, entitled people (a.k.a. 'customers) for a meager paycheck, and all those put-downs you think of will be nothing but water cooler talk, because you NEED that job. What does this have to do with dress codes? Theirs will be very strict. Stupid shirt with a corporate logo, slacks, functional, but very unfashionable shoes, and a stupid little nametag with just your first name and a non-descriptive, focus group tested job title on it so people you loathe can know who to report to the manager when you don't grind the world to a halt to get them something you don't even have the power to provide. And I haven't even started on hair nets. Oh, but maybe not you. You're going to get a scholarship to college and skip straight to the corporate world, where you have to wear nice clothes, which are probably stuff, and uncomfortable shoes. Jeans, capris, shorts, sandals, t-shirts, halter tops, and everything else you wear for comfort will be for weekends only, and I don't mean 'unless you go clubbing.' You will not go clubbing on work nights, because if you show up for work the next day hung over, you're fired. Welcome to the real world. You can leave your Abercrombie wardrobe right where you left your dreams of growing up to be a wizard."

MouseSports- ChrisJ also looks out of his regular form, granted he did pick it up a bit for the major but I feel like that was because of the Oskar joining Mousesports rumor I honestly have seen the best AWPing from Fallen on SK and from Snax on VP then I have from all of the aforementioned players.

And guess what? that field isn't just straight up fueled by hate like Tumblr is, because it's so underfunded that you really need to actually do a good job in order to get a job let alone keep it. This woman is very bad at gender egalitarianism, in my opinion. It's a really narrow and lazy attempt at creating an egalitarian environment. One of the first tenets of most forms of gender egalitarianism is that equal consideration /= equal treatment. Men's health is different from women's health, but I want everyone to he healthy. The evil you're describing doesn't exist except on some idiots' Tumblrs. Just because they say they are a feminist or egalitarian does not make them one, and in fact in my opinion these people disrespect the centuries of progress women have gained by pretending like they can engage in meaningful theory without any qualifications."

At_the_office12	MMA	0	0	0	2016-07	1469911608	I'm all for Conor staying at 145 and defend the belt or just relinquish it and move to 155 but how has he dodged tough match ups? He had his easy fights as a starter like all do with the fights vs brimage and brandao, taking on holloway in between when he was already a great prospect and is undefeated ever since. Then he dispatched Poirier who is a massive contender and had already a FotY with the Korean Zombie and dispatched him in seconds. At this time he knew he had to be the contender because like the flywheight division, the champion had already cleared all the immediate ranked fighters bellow him. Yes you can argue that Siver was nothing more but a tune up fight but who was aldo going to face if you still matched Conor with edgar and chad? The division was completely stale and great fights warranted little revenue, while an excellent marketable fighter has been putting up exciting finishes in all his fight but for the one he tore his acl (and still won). And he ended up fighting chad whose style is as bad as it gets match up wise. Then he went on to beat the champion. A rematch with aldo and holloway and one fight with Edgar is all that is left for conor to clean his division. Because even though they are exciting to watch, stevens, llamas or swanson would be destroyed by conor."

Emperor_Mao	worldnews	1	1	0	2016-08	1471061510	the wording of this report is very unclear. 1/4 will have the disease? or 1/4 will have at some point had the disease? in other words is this a prevalence or an incidence? these are very different measures. i couldn't find a primary source for this information. also remember that few people that contract the disease actually suffer symptoms, which are usually mild. and that the risk of microcephaly in children of infected women is 10-15%. So even if it were 25% of the population, how many of those are pregnant women in their first trimester? For reference, Brazil, a much larger country, has about 5000 cases of zika-linked microcephaly. Zika isnt really the global health mega-crisis that people are making it out to be. It's still something that we need to be concerned about and deserves our attention, but other diseases are far worse (malaria, for instance). Hopefully all this attention helps funding and awareness efforts for against mosquito borne diseases."

And it's fun sharing that experience with a friend and it's what makes it fun. Personally I don't play the game at all in Solo queue any more. It's not fun and not really the way the game is meant to be played as the core aspect of the game is centered around working together. I'd rather instead of removing duo queue from HL and making into an even more 'no-fun zone' they instead add more ways for players on a team to communicate with each other, since the game is so heavily centered around the team as a whole rather than five individuals."

Me and my ex girlfriend split a month ago because things weren't working out and she honestly was crazy. She got a new boyfriend quickly and apparently made me look out as if I was a huge douchebag and a cheater who greatly hurt her. He got my number and was talking smack and threatening to fight me if he sees me (same college campus). I have a lot of confidence in my BJJ skills as I am very close to becoming a blue belt. I'm a humble person and I train for skill and not to hurt. But should this fight happen, then what's a way to end this without breaking anything on him? I will not be the aggressor as I don't want any legal issues on my hand but I do want to protect myself."

I've done hundreds of flawless runs with my friend and so he was down to join even though we both went flawless a few times already this week. And so I asked the random guardian to grab his passage, get all the boons and invite me to his fireteam. Our first match was against a pretty good team and we ended up losing. The guy was pretty average and it became apparent this wasn't gonna be an easy carry. I asked him to get a new passage and so he did and we started a second run. We won the first two matches but lost the third one. I didn't ask him to restart his passage this time. We continued and I said whatever happens, happens. The random guardian seemed to be getting into the rhythm of playing with us and was doing better every match. Our last two matches were tough but we managed to win them and get the guy his first flawless. He was so happy to get to the lighthouse for the first time and kept sending us thank you messages long after he left our party. It felt great."

Seems to be that kinetic i used to play with just sucks balls now, gunner was way way more better. There was some new quests i did until they all wanted me to go 5man dungeon.... this is where it became bad. Queue is still endless, it will never start. No matter witch one of the 5man i queue, one with quest, one with tablet, one with pommel.... it NEVER starts. I tried to spend some of my sparks, until i realized im stuck because of those purple cockblock sparks you need to grind in that openworld area.... that area is fkin empty, no ppls there and no way you can solo those mobs. They rekt you in 5sec if you try to solo them. So i am asking, is there any point to even try playing this game anymore? Im i only wasting my time trying to find group for the 5mans/cockblock sparks?"

Getting married in three months and my whole extended family is pretty much TBM (all 60 or so of them) and have no idea I am a ex Mormon They also don't know my fiancee is a atheist and that we want to have a non religious wedding. Normally I am calm and collected but the closer the date comes the more nervous I get that they will completely ruin my whole day when they find out we are doing it as religious free as possible... My TBM parents know about me and about my fiancee and have told me not to say a word to my extended family, especially my grandparents because they fear they will get outlash from them. Which has put me in this awkward position of more or less hiding my beliefs from most of my family. (Mind you this is just my fathers side. My mothers side is also clueless and her brother is a bishop) I just need words of encouragement as this day grows closer from people who actually understand what its like to go through this. Because I am terrified my extended family will hate me, but I am even more terrified my grandparents won't want anything to do with me (they did this to one of my cousins when she had kids before she got married and still talk crap about her). I have a very close relationship with them to so I'm worried."

La marijuana non e' illegale perche' fa male. Sia ben chiaro. Se le cose fossero illegali perche' facessero male, il mondo sarebbe un posto molto diverso. Sono dogmi.

Se non e' una cosa che ti aggrada cosa cazzo te ne frega a te? Se non hai ancora avuto modo nella vita di vederlo con i tuoi occhi bhe te lo dico io, nessuno delle persone che conoscerai mai nella vita morira o combinera dei casini per la mariujana. La mariuana e' illegale per una serie di motivi che non hanno niente a che vedere con bene e male giusto o sbagliato sano o malsano. Se la tua opinione della mariuana e' formulata dal sentito dire o delle opinioni di esperti medici, ti assicuro che hai una opinione distorta dalla propaganda. Per il semplice fatto che la medicinia moderna non sa ancora niente delle potenzialita' di questa pianta. Per 60 anni e' stata demonizzata per motivi economico sociali. Se quel barbone di Mussolini aveva le palle invece di essere un codardo follower di potenti(piccolo uomo mussolini) in italia avremmo l'industria piu prolifica del mondo, producendo canapa.

"1	Yes I love added cup resonance	24grant24	headphones	2	2	0	2016-05	1463948552	Does anyone prefer the sound of closed headphones? Disregarding the advantage of sound isolation for closed-back, does anyone actually prefer closed to open purely based on sound quality? Often I see open vs closed displayed as a sacrifice, in which it's sound isolation at the cost of sound quality. However, can it really be that objective with Opens sounding better than a similarly priced closed competitor? Although obviously there are many high-end closed-backs that destroy open-backs in terms of soundstage and sound fidelity, the reason I ask is because I am comparing two competitors, one open and one closed, at the same price point and from the same manufacturer. I'm referring to the Sennheiser Game One vs Game Zero, with the difference being closed (Zero) and open (One). I currently use the Ones (I understand HD598+modmic is probably a cheaper option, but I like the g4m3r c0lorZ lel), but I'm interested in attending LAN events and maybe for public use (I'm gonna look dumb with the giant mic, but whatever). I had the inclination to view this decision with the common sacrifice approach (+isolation, -worse sound), but in an attempt to be more enthusiastic with my decision, is it possible I might prefer it? I listen to some bass heavy music like EDM, DnB, and Rap, and while Sennheiser is generally lacking in bass, perhaps the closed variant might improve this a little? Maybe I prefer the in-your-head feeling compared to the airiness of Ones? Thoughts?"

That doesn't encourage people to share the draft. Sometimes, it just doesn't work for some reason (internet connection/wrong software version/ computer too slow/...). In that case, your friend has to tell/write you the three options each time to make the draft. Not only is it annoying, but it alters the decision making because you can't see the deck curve and the cards list. But that is not the point. **A spectate mode for the draft** would make it much easier to start an arena run with a friend. And especially with *any* of your friends in your friendlist, at least **much more easily**. I believe it could really boost arena : * New players could be helped by experienced players from the beginning to the end of the run * People who know the game mechanics but lack experience in arena drafting could be easily helped for that step only (since it takes less effort and time to share it) * People could randomly spectate friendly drafts, and therefore would know better the arena draft meta (the cards that are often proposed in the drafts) Overall, I think people would get more familiar with the arena, and hopefully more people would play that great mode."

"1	Well, the Muslims had god on their side	Evilpagan	history	1	1	0	2016-05	1464526844	Maybe not the greatest military blunder but a pretty damn important one. The Battle of Yarmouk between the Byzantines and the Rashidun Muslims. Modern estimates are that and army of 100,000-150,000 Byzantine soldiers were practically annihilated by a force of around 20,000 Arabs. It opened to the way for massive Muslim expansion into the Levant, across North Africa, into Spain. This loss was a blow to the Byzantines that their empire would never recover from, allowing for later Muslim expansion into the Balkans and eastern Europe. So how do you possibly lose a battle on an open field while outnumbering the enemy nearly 8:1? By attacking, half-heartedly with predictable frontal assaults over carefully planned trenches and defenses, 5 different times. By seemingly forgetting to use the bulk of your cavalry and leaving them in reserve for most of the 6 day battle. By not sending out effective scouts to watch the enemy and by not guarding important retreat paths even with the men to spare. Khalid ibn al-Walid lead the Arabs and successfully threw the Byzantines back 5 days in a row by masterfully directing his soldiers and especially cavalry to quickly react to any section of the line that needed help. After the 5th day of battle, he sent 500 of his precious few men to set up an ambush on the most likely enemy retreat route, a narrow bridge. On the 6th day he led an attack on the still massive, but hugely demoralized Byzantine army. His cavalry were grouped into one large formation and sent to destroy the Byzantine reserve force while the rest of his men split the larger army into smaller pockets which were focused and routed. Almost all of the Byzantines who escaped the battle where cut down by the 500 men sent to the bridge, the night before. If this single battle had gone differently, the Byzantine Empire would have been in a strong position relative to its neighbors and may have never fallen. Islam may have never spread into Africa at all, possibly even meeting the same fate as Zoroastrianism if vengeful Byzantines attempted to subjugate Arabia. The importance of this single military failure for the Byzantines is huge and I think it's a pretty epic example what happens when an incompetent general meets a military genius in battle."
